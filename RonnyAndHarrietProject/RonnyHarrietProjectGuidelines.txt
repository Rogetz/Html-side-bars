landing page design

Start with a favicon, the favicnon is simply derived from the logo.
First the logo should be a very captivating one. evenly placed some pixels a away from the top margin.
First I must create an image slider just right above the search bar. Its an image slider designed in the same way as that of shopify, bu here it is horizontally placed.
The second thing it must have a very cool pictorial layout blenede with some colour, of course with a clip-path twist.
I can actually use two clip paths one, for the polygon and the other for the circle, or rather a small circle with a pop up of what we do.
